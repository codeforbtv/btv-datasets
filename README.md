# btv-datasets

## Purpose
The overall goal of this fledgling project is to make publicly available data more accessible. We intend to pull together and document the myriad of datasets concerning Burlington, as well as the entire state of Vermont.  
These data are often spread around a variety of websites, and as a result data discovery is a significant initial hurdle to working with BTV data. We intend to lower this barrier by documenting both the locations and contents of various databases.  
This project is in its infancy. As of now, we have limited our goals to discovering and documenting the data available to us. In the future, this project will certainly expand, and likely will spin off into a variety of avenues we have yet to even dream of. That's where you come in! If you have an idea you want help with, if you want to help with this project, or if you just want to see what Code for BTV is all about, come join us on [Slack](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfroVbMQ9PRmO0QadTWAB1LkAjBkurNTz1Y9E1664nzsrXTGQ/viewform?c=0&w=1)!
